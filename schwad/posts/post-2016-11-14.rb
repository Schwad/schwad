  p "Okay, well, if I can be a trained padawan (sp?) in ERB and then work my day
  job in Haml the _why-friendly Markaby should definitely be doable."

  p "I spent much of today trying to get camping to dynamically render markaby
  from separated out posts on one page. Nothing fancy yet. No CSS (not that I
  may want any for this page), no cool github gists, just refactored post storage.
  And by gum, with my first actually-needing-usage of `eval`, it seems to be
  working. Not 100 percent dynamic... but close."

  p "My ultimate goal, since this is a private project and I can do-what-I-want,
  is to improve on this, learn camping and scale. The second phase will be deploying
  this on a linux machine with a Shoes.rb text-editor application that will allow
  me to write my posts in shoes, save them to my hard drive, and have them published
  on my live camping-style site. Not bad. I wouldn't be the first (nor last) dev
  to opt for an HTML-only-heavy style personal site anyway. I just need to up
  my markaby game now."
